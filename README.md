# Fairness-SVM
Graduate Course ECE 532  Matrix method in machine learning Final project. 

## Problem Statement

Introduce notion of fairness to train a SVM binary classifier model which maximizes the margin subject to a additional fairness constraints during the training process. <br> 
Goal of the project is to understand  the various causes of bias in machine learning system, Introduce a new type of fairness regularizer and learn it effects, Implement the fair classifier using SVMs and analyze the model and Analyze the tradeoff between fairness and accuracy.
